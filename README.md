# HemaB-Class – v1.0

HemB-Class” is a machine learning framework for classifying the clinical severity of Hemophilia B, 
caused by point mutations. 
It uses datasets of known mutations (presumably labelled “severe” vs “mild/moderate”) to train classifiers. 
It includes pre-trained models / results, code for reproducing experiments, scripts for visualization (ROC curves, heatmaps, etc.).
The framework is written using R (scripts), with a mix of “src”, “dataset”, “results”, etc. 
Despite limited training data, it attempts careful optimization, and also makes predictions on “residues not yet reported in literature”.
